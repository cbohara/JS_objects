# Objects

## Goals

As is, the repository is missing code for most of the functions. It's your job
to fix the library by implementing them. In this section, the functions have to do with Objects and their use in Javascript.

The files in the `spec` directory contain the test suites. Your goal is to get all the tests to pass by implementing the missing functions. Run all the tests by opening `SpecRunner.html` in your browser.

The file `src/objects.js` contains function definitions and explanations for the following functions (*italicized functions* are solved for you). Pass each of the tests by having the functions return the correct value:


#### Tests:
- [ ] MysticalAnimal
- [ ] AddFirstProperty
- [ ] AddSecondProperty
- [ ] AddThirdProperty
- [ ] AddFourthProperty
- [ ] AddFifthProperty
- [ ] AccessFirstProperty
- [ ] AccessSecondProperty
- [ ] AccessThirdProperty
- [ ] AccessFourthProperty
- [ ] AccessFifthProperty
- [ ] AddSixProperty
- [ ] VariablePracticeOne
- [ ] VariablePracticeTwo
- [ ] LiteralObject
